# Some things I'm proud to have worked on

I've been in software since 2006, I've worked on lots of things. Most of them have been things I can't publicly share because they're behind corporate firewalls, require special access to get to, or I'm just not allowed to share them. 

However, there are a few things which I'm very proud to share with the world.

## Creating an Engineering-Centric Culture at DEPT® Agency

One of the more public faces of this is DEPT®'s [Engineering Soapboxes](https://github.com/deptagency/engineering-soapboxes).

You can read a [full explanation of what they are here](https://engineering.deptagency.com/introducing-web-blueprint-our-practices-for-web-development), but the gist is an open source volume of seasoned developers' takes on how to build software. I was responsible for bootstrapping them and getting the team to contribute.  I also contributed a bunch as well.

## The MITRE@Work Mobile Application

I was an architect and product manager of a mobile application used by the entire workforce of the [MITRE Corporation](https://www.mitre.org/), which at the time was over 11,000 employees.

You can read a bit about it and see a small screenshot at [StepTwo](https://www.steptwo.com.au/award-winner/mitre-corporation-creating-a-mobile-app-to-get-things-done/) and also on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mitre.mobile.arcadia&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1).

The application was created natively for both iOS (Swift) and Android natively. It was designed and coded from the ground up. It allowed employees to log time and view meetings on personal devices which was unprecented for the company at the time due to numerous security challenges due to the sensitive nature of MITRE's work for the Federal Government of the United States.

I staffed the team, designed the backend architecture and contributed a fair amount of backend Node.js code. This backend system had to navigate those security challenges in order to pass data safely from an internal datacenter through the public cloud and onto employee's personal devices safely.

## Open Sourcing Whatever I Can

I love open source software and try to contribute back whenever I can. With two kids, I don't have much time, but what I can I put [my Github profile](https://github.com/theothermattm?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=&sort=stargazers)

Though I'm not actively involved with any major open source projects, I do try to contribute the odd bugfix or even just log an issue to contribute.
