In high school and college, I had a job doing customer service on the phone for a pet supply company. This was before the days when ecommerce was king, so a lot of people placed phone orders and had to call in to talk to a live human when they had problems with their orders.

The job was excruciatingly boring, as most calls were simply processing a return for a single item.  Things that today would be automated by nice ecommerce web apps. However, there was still the occasional tough problem to solve, and there were _plenty_ of angry customers to deal with.

I remember having much less problems than my other fellow customer service reps. They would often get in tiffs with customers and the customers would escalate to management. It happened to me too, but not nearly as much. Probably because I've always been conflict averse, but I also listen well.

When I was interviewing for jobs out of college, I remember one interview vividly where a high level manager who was interviewing me kept asking me about my customer service job. I thought it was so strange. I had prepared for all these technical questions and this guy was asking me what I learned at my shitty high school job returning pet supplies?

I got the job and found out a couple years later that guy still remembered my interview.  I asked him about it and he said he thought that my customer service skills were something that was really important to being in the software/IT industry.

Looking back, I can completely see why.  Those skills have helped me navigate difficult people and situations really well.
