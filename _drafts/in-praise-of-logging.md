Even though in my day to day job, I'm not coding as much as I used to, I still _review_ lots of code. One of the things I find myself leaving comments about a **lot** is adding logging statements at various levels. I find that most people don't share my love of logging and why it can be great. 

My job in this post is to convince you why you should love logging and how!

I cut my development teeth in the Java world. Since this post is targeted at Javascript developers, please reserve your judgement and believe me when I say: Java does logging well. There are a number of battle tested libraries that allow for out of the box ease, as well as endless customizability.

One thing I've noticed in the node.js world is a general lack of appreciation or knowledge of a good logging framework. This is starting to change with things like [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/logger) on the backend providing an opinionated way to do this.  

In this post, I'm going to outline what I've learned
