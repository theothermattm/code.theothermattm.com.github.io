I have vivid memories of my school break the summer before I had to work. It was a weird year between not really needing to have a babysitter and being too young to work a real job. I sat in front of our family Packard Bell computer most of that summer discovering the joys of the early internet. The sense of wonder about what the internet was and what you could find there was palpable. The sense of excitement about what you might discover on it was visceral to a teenager. There was nothing but hopefulness ahead.

This was before the TCP/IP stack was even part of a standard Windows OS. We had Windows 3.1 installed. The local ISP (yes, LOCAL) snail-mailed me a set of floppy disks with Winsock on them to install. I remember taking a deep breath, hoping my dad wouldn't be pissed at me if I screwed the computer up putting this crazy software on it. Something I specifically remember is that somehow Winsock would change the boot screen. That seemed scary to me. 

I do remember hitting issues and having to call the local ISP, and the owners walked me through the install process and some troubleshooting. I think this somehow 
involved defragging my hard drive.  Remember that?

The majority of that summer I spent on the IRC server for a Boston radio station WAAF. For those of you who don't know IRC, think slack but with self hosted servers with no persistent messages. Total anonymity with no fear of what you said coming back to haunt you. Plenty of illegal things going on including downloading movies and music. I made friends on that IRC server that summer, including people I would meet in real life. Before meeting people on the internet was considered mainstream and acceptable. I remember my mother being freaked out I would meet someone on the internet. Now, as a parent, I don't blame her, but it was always in public spaces and safe.

Getting Mortal Kombat fatalities from AOL sites and printing them out, bringing them to the arcade.

The magic of making my first website.  One of the first times I felt like I created something.  An amazing feeling.  The magic of learning how HTML could transform to something on the screen.

Being on dialup made you appreciate things more.

The hesitancy of people using credit cards on the internet for fear their information would be stolen even though it was far more likely some waiter would take their info.

Getting the phone picked up and interrupting your dialup download.

Getting single MP3's off dialup.
