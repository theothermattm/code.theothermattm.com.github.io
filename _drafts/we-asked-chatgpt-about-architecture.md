# We asked ChatGPT to architect our application and this is what happened

I opened up my laptop Monday morning and saw this email from the CEO:

> We're pivoting. We need a new app, fast! New idea is basically Uber for dogs. If you need a cute dog, quick, this app will get you a dog to rent, FAST. It has to have an excellent native iOS and Android app. Need it by next monday.

After wiping up the coffee I spit out on my desk and gathered my sanity, I was blanking on where to start. Then I remembered that ChatGPT is here to help me get started.

So, we asked ChatGPT to help us get started with our architecture. This is what happened.

> Design an architecture for an iOS and Android app that is Uber for Dog rentals. It has to be really fast, secure and highly available.
