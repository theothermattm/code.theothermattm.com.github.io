I was having a discussion with a fellow Engineering Manager the other day and I heard this.

"Maybe I'm crazy, but in those situations I immediately step back and see if I did something wrong."

It stuck out to me because this is my reaction in tense situations as well.

I think it comes from a lack of self confidence as a kid. Not sure.

However, it made me realize, that this reaction is a good quality of leadership.

I'm calling it the "Am I the asshole? Reflex."

One of the bigger subreddits out there is [r/AmITheAsshole?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA/), where anyone can post an anecdote about an experience they had
where they can ask the community if they were the asshole in a situation that bothered them. They range from hilarious to genuinely intriguing.
