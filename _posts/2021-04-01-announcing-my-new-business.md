I'm happy to announce that I've started a new business.  This is a side gig right now, but once this takes off, I expect to become independently wealthy from it.

:drumroll: Announcing.....
## [The JVM Jargon Generator](https://kotlin-jvm-jargon-generator.fly.dev/)

Years of toiling away with Java Virtual Machine (JVM) technologies made me realize that the only thing that really matters when developing in the JVM space is that you can <em>intelligently talk about it</em>.  These complex projects rarely get deployed to production or used by users, so it's usually sufficient to just have a headline and be able to talk circles around your businesspeople to confuse them.  Then, you can go have a beer.

Written in state of the art Kotlin using complex AI (if/else blocks and switch statements) it is truly a groundbreaking piece of technology.

Please send me copious amounts of money so I can buy a beach house and retire.  Thanks!

_Postscript January,2023:_
Since Heroku decided to [shut down their free tier](https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter) ðŸ˜¡, I moved this app over to [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) which has been an absolute pleasure and something I plan on writing about.
