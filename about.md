I've been working with software development since 2006 in a variety of roles from support to team lead.

Most of my work has been in server-side Java, however, I've also done plenty of work on the front end side of the web as well.

In my current role, I'm writing applications and services in Node.js and AngularJS.

I also enjoy photography. You can see some of my stuff <a title="on flickr" href="http://flickr.com/theothermattm" target="_blank">on Flickr</a>
