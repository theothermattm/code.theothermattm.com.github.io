I've been working with software development since 2006 in a variety of roles from support to team lead, to architect, to manager, etc.

I tend to lean towards Cloud Engineering, Backend/API/serverside development. I've done quite a bit of work in Node.js and Javascript, but love lots of other languages. I'm also a bit of a database nerd.

I also enjoy photography. You can see some of my stuff [on Flickr](http://flickr.com/theothermattm)
