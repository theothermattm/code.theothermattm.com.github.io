# Hi, I'm Matt

I like to build stuff, and I like talking to people about building stuff. 

I've been working in software since 2005 in various roles, including operational support, engineer, team lead, architect, manager, and even product manager.

I lean towards Backend, Systems, and Cloud Engineering. I'm also a database nerd. I've done a lot of work in Java and Node.js/Javascript, but I love lots of other languages. 

These days, I manage engineers, do architecture, and lead technical projects. I love helping people grow while remaining deeply involved with technology.

You can learn more about what I've built in my [Portfolio](/portfolio), on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theothermattm/), and on my [Github](https://github.com/theothermattm). You can also find out more details about my work background [on my resume](/assets/resume-latest.pdf).

I'm also a firm believer in the open web and open-source software. That's why I have an old-fashioned blog on the open web instead of a medium account.

I work to live, but I also love my work. When living, I'm a dad to two kids and a husband. I run a lot. When I have time, I play guitar. I also enjoy photography but only get to do it a little beyond snapping photos of the family on the iPhone. But you can still see some of my older photos [on Flickr](http://flickr.com/theothermattm).
