# Hi, I'm Matt

I like to build stuff.

I've been working with software development since 2006 in a variety of roles from support to team lead, to architect, to manager, etc.

I tend to lean towards Cloud Engineering, Backend/API/serverside development. I've done quite a bit of work in Node.js and Javascript, but love lots of other languages. I'm also a bit of a database nerd.

These days, I mostly manage engineers. I've found I love the combination of helping people and technology.

You can learn more about what I do for a living on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theothermattm/) and my [Github](https://github.com/theothermattm)

I also enjoy photography. You can see some of my older stuff [on Flickr](http://flickr.com/theothermattm)
